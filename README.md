# Harmonograph
Harmonograph application with graphical UI and audio output written in Processing

**To use:** download the Processing IDE from processing.org and import the processing foundation sound library and controlP5 library by going to "sketch-> import library-> add library" and installing the required libraries

Explore the program by seting the various sliders to different values and then flip the start switch, or if you want press the "Random" button to randomize all values

Sound is applied as waveforms from the radio buttons *try use more than one at the same time, but watch out for the reverb on the triangle wave!*

Hope you enjoy!
